mern basic application
## I follow the setps below to create the MERN App.
* Copy the boilerplate code from other applications. All the necessary folders for the MERN application have been created.
* Define the MongoDB schema for the application. The number of schemas defined in the application depends on the number of tables you want to manage in your application. All the schemas should be defined within the models folder.

* Define the controls that you will use in your application within the controls folder. The number of controls you use in your application depends on the the schemas you have in your models folder. If more than one control is used in your application, you have to add index.js file to export all the controls in your application.

* Define the routes for your application. Use express webserver's router to define your route files.
